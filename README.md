# SaveAPlate

SaveAPlate is an innovative project designed to address food waste by tracking the production and consumption of food items over a period of four days. Our primary objective is to identify unique food items each day, monitor the amount of food prepared, record the leftovers, and ultimately calculate a reduction percentage to optimize food production and minimize waste. This approach aims at promoting sustainable food management practices in environments such as restaurants, cafeterias, and event catering services.
